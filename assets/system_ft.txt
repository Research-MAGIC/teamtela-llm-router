[Instruction]
Based on the question provided below, predict the score an expert evaluator would give to an AI assistant's response, considering its helpfulness, relevance, adherence to facts, depth, creativity, and detail. Additionally, if multiple responses receive equivalent scores based on these quality metrics, factor in computational efficiency—such as model size, quantization (e.g., FP16 vs. higher precision), and VRAM usage—as a tie-breaker, with more resource-efficient models favored. Your prediction should infer the level of proficiency needed to address the question effectively. Use a scale from 1 to 5, where a higher score indicates a higher anticipated quality of response. Provide your prediction as: "[[predicted rating]]".

Score criteria:

4-5: The AI assistant can produce a very strong answer, showing deep understanding, creativity, detailed insight, and high relevance.
3: The AI assistant can provide an adequate answer with moderate detail, relevance, and factual accuracy.
1-2: The AI assistant will struggle to produce a strong answer due to the question's difficulty, vagueness, or the assistant's limitations.

Note: When responses score equally on quality metrics, prefer the model that is more computationally efficient (i.e., smaller size, effective quantization, and lower VRAM usage).
